# Account management

Audit baseline: TST `5faee9df930bd76b5e56b669f58a57210527f7d5`, inspected 2026-10-10.

Shared agency and wholesale directories expose tenant notes, contacts, tags, targeting, relationship stage, Worklist, visits, photos and relevant sales. Wholesale import protection and platform merge authorization are established behavior. Retail/Restaurants directories now respect tenant state access. Tenant overlays support account categories, parent groups, geographic territories, teams, typed custom fields and document references; contacts can link the same person across accounts. Existing directory identities remain authoritative. Preserve raw OHLQ identifiers.

## Implementation references

- `app/agencies/[id]/page.tsx`
- `app/wholesale/[id]/page.tsx`
- `lib/accountMemory.ts`

## Validation and remaining work

See [implementation progress](../engineering/implementation-progress.md), [feature inventory](../product/feature-inventory.md), and [test report](../releases/v0.2-test-report.md). Existing behavior above is source-audited; it is not a claim of fresh live verification. Changes must update this document and the inventory.
