## Changes

Owner-authorized test/developer-tooling maintenance, October 29, 2026. The application feature freeze and version 0.5.0 remain; this maintenance does not open a feature cycle or authorize production promotion.

- Remove 28 obsolete or duplicate test cases while retaining current security, lifecycle, calendar and retirement guards; preserve unique state-change audit assertions in the stronger whole-module test.
- Add an explicit-file `test:focus` command and document focused iteration with one full-suite delivery gate. Remove artificial per-record fixture timers without removing concurrency coverage.
- Exclude scratch copies under `output/`, `tmp/` and `.codex-worktrees/` from TypeScript discovery. No cleanup files are deleted.
- Correct integration instructions that still referenced deleted SMS/Recipe scripts and retired mailbox/AI behavior.
- Validation and exact scope: [test efficiency audit](../engineering/test-efficiency-audit.md). No application runtime, dependency, schema, migration, provider, feature flag or hosted-setting changes.
